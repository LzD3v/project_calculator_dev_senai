 #### Description of the Calculation function
To carry out the mathematical calculations, the "eval" function was used.

The basic syntax of the eval( ) function is as follows:
```
eval(code)
```
obs: Even though the eval( ) function is not considered safe in professional projects, as it can execute malicious code, this project was carried out for teaching purposes only and will not be used professionally.
